In discussion-based classes, I like to have students come up with a class charter. This is a collaboratively drafted document that spells out the guidelines for participation in the course. To prepare to write this charter tomorrow, reflect on the following:
* What was your best classroom experience? Why was it so great?
* What was your worst classroom experience? Why was it so terrible?
* What are the qualities that make for a positive, safe, productive, generative, enriching classroom? 
* What about this online format? What other considerations should we keep in mind?

Do some serious brainstorming for Assignment #1! A full draft will be due Friday. Is there a piece of old technology you've always wondered about? Walk around your house (normally I'd suggest going to a thrift store or an older relative's house, but not today) and see what remnants might be there. Have a conversation with someone older than you. Maybe you have a favorite old movie or period piece that might have some inspiration. And of course there's always eBay or Etsy. I recommend making a list or creating a mindmap. You could also check out websites like the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) or [Collectors Weekly](https://www.collectorsweekly.com/). In fact, Collectors Weekly is a great example of what your essay might look like!

Do some brainstorming for Assignment #3 Unessay. This is a creative assignment! Don't freak yet. Give yourself a little time to let your mind chew on this idea. Freewriting can help! What has most intrigued you in this course so far? What challenges did you identify early on that you might want to pick back up? What new things do you want to tackle? I recognize it's a tough time to be creative, but I want this assignment to help you work through the issues we've talked about so far in this course - in whatever manner works best for you. When/where/how are you your most creative? How can you harness that for this assignment?
