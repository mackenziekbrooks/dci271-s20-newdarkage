Everything with this label are activities you should do on the day if possible. Discussion questions are meant to prompt conversation. You don't have to answer every one, instead, look for ways to engage with the ideas of your classmates.

Readings and recorded lectures will appear with this label. They should be done on the day listed if possible.	

Reflect 
{: .label .label-purple }
Reflections are thinking/writing prompts that will not be turned in. I encourage you to take some time away from screen to your answers by hand. If you want some accountability or feedback, you can take a picture of your writing or copy and paste and send it to me directly on Slack. You could also send yourself a message on Slack!

* Based on what you know of the course thus far, what are your biggest questions about the course itself? 
* Your normal routine of going to class has changed. How will you try to stay engaged? What can you do to set up new routines? What habits will help you, and what habits might be less than useful? 
* What questions do you have about technology in society? What fascinates you? What scares you? You will be able to choose your topics for most of your assignments. What topics might you want to explore? 


## Thursday, April 30 

Read/Watch
{: .label .label-green }
* Canvas/YuJa: [Chap 1 lecture video](https://wlu.yuja.com/V/MediaFile?mediaFile=76267&node=3995455&a=389970748&autoplay=1)

Participate 
{: .label .label-yellow }
* Slack: icebreaker of the day
* Slack: Chapter 1 discussion. Posted in #discussion channel. 
	* What are the greatest challenges in the world today from your perspective? How is technology involved? 
	* What aspects of technology scare you the most? Excite you? 
	* How have you seen technology change in your lifetime?
	* What are your biggest questions about technology and the future? 
	* What does it mean to “think critically?” Have you learned skills at W&L (or elsewhere) that have helped you think critically? 



Reflect
{: .label .label-purple }
In discussion-based classes, I like to have students come up with a class charter. This is a collaboratively drafted document that spells out the guidelines for participation in the course. To prepare to write this charter tomorrow, reflect on the following:
* What was your best classroom experience? Why was it so great?
* What was your worst classroom experience? Why was it so terrible?
* What are the qualities that make for a positive, safe, productive, generative, enriching classroom? 
* What about this online format? What other considerations should we keep in mind? 


## Friday, May 1 

Read/Watch
{: .label .label-green }
* Start reading *New Dark Age* chapter 2. 
* Read [The Digital Cloud and the Micropolitics of Energy](https://wlu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01WLU_INST/12srbpt/duke10.1215%252F08992363-2392093) over the weekend.
* Watch Assignment #1 Dead Tech intro video. Start brainstorming ideas for this project. 

Participate 
{: .label .label-yellow }
* Slack: icebreaker of the day
* Slack: Share a summary of your reflections on the reflection questions from yesterday. What are the shared values for a positive classroom experience? How can we carry those values through an online format? Use the Post feature in Slack to create a shared document where you write out your charter. Sign your name at the end when the document is complete. Here's some [examples](https://praxis.scholarslab.org/resources/toward-a-project-charter/) if you need them.


# Week 2 - Computation & Cognition 

## Monday, May 4 

Read/Watch
{: .label .label-green }
* Finish reading *New Dark Age* chapter 2
* Canvas/Yuja: [Chapter 2 lecture part 1](https://wlu.yuja.com/V/MediaFile?mediaFile=80516&node=4022635&a=76478128&autoplay=1) 

Participate 
{: .label .label-yellow }
* Slack: icebreaker of the day
* Slack: Answer Chapter 2 discussion questions
	* Do you agree with Bridle’s take here (pg 34)? What are some examples of the ways that computers reduce complexity? What are examples of ways they “freeze the problems of the immediate moment into abstract, intractable dilemmas?”
	* What did you take away from this section? What questions do you still have? Is there a particular technology whose history intrigues you? 
	* Bridle obviously has his own motivations for telling this history the way he does. What’s missing from his telling? How might a historian tell it differently? 


Reflect
{: .label .label-purple }
Do some serious brainstorming for Assignment #1! A full draft will be due Friday. Is there a piece of old technology you've always wondered about? Walk around your house (normally I'd suggest going to a thrift store or an older relative's house, but not today) and see what remnants might be there. Have a conversation with someone older than you. Maybe you have a favorite old movie or period piece that might have some inspiration. And of course there's always eBay or Etsy. I recommend making a list or creating a mindmap. You could also check out websites like the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/) or [Collectors Weekly](https://www.collectorsweekly.com/). In fact, Collectors Weekly is a great example of what your essay might look like!

Do some brainstorming for Assignment #3 Unessay. This is a creative assignment! Don't freak yet. Give yourself a little time to let your mind chew on this idea. Freewriting can help! What has most intrigued you in this course so far? What challenges did you identify early on that you might want to pick back up? What new things do you want to tackle? I recognize it's a tough time to be creative, but I want this assignment to help you work through the issues we've talked about so far in this course - in whatever manner works best for you. When/where/how are you your most creative? How can you harness that for this assignment?
