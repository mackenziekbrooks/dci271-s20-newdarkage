ATMs

  For my research paper, I decided to research ATMs. Although ATMs are not necessarily “dead tech,” many people believe that they are on the decline. After researching further, I went on to create my own argument regarding ATMs and there past, present, and future impacts. There past revolves around the creation and its impact on banking usage and banks in general. The present describes what they are being used for now. The future is my opinion regarding what will happen with ATMs in the future.

  ATM stands for automated teller machine. The first automated teller machine was created in 1967 and installed in a suburb of London. “One New York bank touted the innovation with an ad that told customers, “On Sept. 2, our banks will open at 9 a.m. and never close again," according to Smithsonian Magazine” (Pete). This goes to show how much the banks loved these new machines. The ATMs have made withdrawing cash substantially easier and it is estimated that over eighty percent of all withdrawals are done from ATMs. Since then, over 3.5 million ATMs have been installed across world. In 1960, the Bankograph was invented, but it did not quite catch on like the ATM. The Bankgraph was a machine that allowed customers to deposit cash and checks into it. It didn’t work as well because there was a lack of trust and its only business were gamblers and other people with dirty money. Now, modern day ATMs have implemented a much more reliable process of depositing money.
  Present day ATMs are much different from those that were made in the late 60s and early 70s. The ATMs of those days were often unreliable and would give you the wrong amount of money, or no money at all. The ATMs also had major security issues as well as the fact that they were just much slower than present day ATMs. ATMs today now have many more security features and you can still manage to get your money, the correct amount, in under thirty seconds. The amount of people using ATMs have also spiked over time. There was a constant increase in usage but now, it is on the decline. There are many reasons for that which I will go into later. Although it has been declining, there are still billions of dollars’ worth of transactions every year in ATMs. The ATMs are transforming to become more and more useful, but can they keep up? Some of these changes include facial recognition that will link a face to a bank account, linking lotteries to ATMs, and finger scanning has been becoming more popular. Now why would an ATM be going out of business?
 
   ATMs have been on the decline for the last couple years for various reasons, one of which is cashless payment. With fewer and fewer places accepting strictly cash, the need for cash has decreased greatly. And with the new mobile payments such as Venmo, cash app, and apple pay, why would consumers need cash? More and more stores are accepting payment by phone whether that is Venmo or apple pay. Venmo is an app on your phone that allows you to pay a person any amount you would like. That is another thing it has over cash, getting the exact amount you want immediately. If you have a 20 and your friend has a 10 but you owe him 12, what are you going to do? That means even if you don’t have your credit card, you can still make purchases. With that being said, do I think that ATMs will go extinct? No. In order for ATMs to become extinct, we must live in a cashless society. I do not see anywhere being a cashless society anytime soon. There are always things one can buy that you must pay for with cash.

  With everything being said, I do believe ATMs are on the decline, but there will always be new technology to improve them and there will always be businesses that only accept cash. I am interested what a cashless world would be like and how technology would factor into it. I believe that if the world was cashless there would be some challenges at first regarding security and also creating counterfeit online money.
