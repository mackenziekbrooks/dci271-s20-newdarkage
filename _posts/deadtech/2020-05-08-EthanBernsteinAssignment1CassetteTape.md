title: The Cassette Tape

In today’s world, easy accessibility to music is thought of more as an expectation than a privilege. With just an Apple Music or Spotify subscription, one can virtually stream any song ever recorded via a computer or smartphone. Throughout the last several decades, massive technological strides have been made toward improving the experience of enjoying music. However, when looking back on which of these innovations were most instrumental leading up to the present, one invention is particularly monumental. The cassette tape was a revolutionary piece of technology that sparked a new era in audio entertainment, setting the precedent for how music would be enjoyed by the masses in the years to follow.

The cassette tape—also known as the compact cassette—was invented by the Philips company in 1962 (Sommerfeld). Cassette tapes function by running tape—which is magnetically-charged—past an electromagnetic receptor that translates these charges into sound waves (Roemer). It was first introduced in August of 1963, and initially was only distributed in Europe, since Philips is a Dutch company (Sommerfeld). However, about a year later in November of 1964, the cassette tape came to the United States (Sommerfeld). Upon the invention of the cassette tape, Philips intended for their product to be used for recording purposes. Philips released their “EL3300 Cassette Recorder,” a device which allowed for voice recording on magnetic audio storage tape (Watts). By 1966, over 250,000 of Philips recorders had been sold in the U.S. (Burr). At first, cassette tapes were not used for listening to music because the audio quality was inferior to that of vinyl records, and eight-track cartridges (Payne). But, because Philips had chosen to “freely license” their cassette tape, this meant that different technology companies could make improvements, and create their own cassette tapes and players (Watts). In 1968, a sound engineer named Ray Dolby had utilized “hiss-reduction technology,” and successfully implemented it in cassette tapes (Payne). Innovations like these drastically improved the sound quality of compact cassettes, and led to the release of pre-recorded audio cassettes that were not blank like the ones used in tape recorders, but rather contained pre-recorded music. These music cassette tapes could then be listened to with cassette players, perhaps most notably: the Sony Walkman (Burr).

The compact cassette was such an important mark in audio technology because it gave anyone the ability to record their own audio. In the present, we take this tool for granted, as we can simply open an application in our smartphones to record a voice memo. In order to record audio back in the 1960s before the cassette tape was introduced, one needed expensive equipment and special training (Sommerfeld). With the creation of the compact cassette, everybody now had the ability to record audio for an affordable price. Furthermore, the introduction of the compact cassette forever improved the way in which people could listen to music. Prior to the invention of the cassette tape, people were confined to radios and vinyl players if they wanted to enjoy music (Sommerfeld). The issue was that audio players such as these were large, and therefore were not easily portable. The cassette tape meant that for the first time, people could listen to music as they went about their daily lives: walking from place to place, exercising, or just simply relaxing. This portability and affordability for ease of use is the primary reason why the introduction of the cassette tape was such a revolutionary audio technology.
    
In 1982, a new form of audio technology was introduced: the compact disc (Payne). The compact disk—otherwise known as the CD—introduced another breakthrough in the world of music and recording: digital audio. However, the cassette tape continued to dominate the audio market through the 1980s; the new CD technology had not yet been refined (Payne). But, in the 1990s—as they were improved and optimized for audio—CDs began to dominate the audio entertainment market. The improved audio quality and more reliable storage medium made CDs more appealing to consumers than the cassette tape, which was beginning to become outdated. By 1993, cassette player shipments dropped by 7%, and by 2001, cassette players accounted for less than 5% of all music sold (Burr). By 2005, nearly every music company in the U.S. ceased production of all cassette tapes (Sommerfeld). 
    
The cassette tape was an extraordinary invention that paved the way for portable audio recording and entertainment. Between 1963 and 1988, upwards of 3 billion cassette tapes were sold around the world (Sommerfeld). Although it became obsolete in the 1990s with the introduction of the CD, the impact of the compact cassette was crucial, perhaps more revolutionary than any other audio innovation. No longer was music something only to be enjoyed in the car or home, but now could be enjoyed in a much more mobile and portable way. In fact, the cassette tape has had a bit of a revival in recent years. Just like many staples of the past, they have become “retro” for current generations, with certain artists releasing new albums on cassette tapes (Sommerfeld). Urban Outfitters—a clothing brand popular among teenagers—even carries cassette tapes in their stores, which is further indication of the cassette tape trend (Sommerfeld).
