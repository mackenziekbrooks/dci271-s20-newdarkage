## A New Post

Cell towers are an important part of almost everybody's day to day life. They provide us with the necessary cell service so that we can stay connected and up to date in the world around us. What made me notice this technology was because it looks like a giant and visually displeasing tree. It uses 5g technology and is likely owned by AT&T or Verizon. I could call both companies and ask for the cell tower locations in order to know who owns it.

Solar panels provide an environmentally friendly way for households to power their homes without using coal or fossil fuels. I see them occasionally in Jacksonville and they are most commonly found on newly developed houses. These panels use the heat provided by the sun's rays and harness its energy with photovoltaic technology. This method of energy production is much better for the environment and leaves a much smaller carbon footprint than coal.

Stoplights can be spotted throughout just about any city and play a major role in our lives virtually every day. I notice them the most when I am coming back from the beach and hit a series of a dozen perfectly timed lights. Without stoplights, there would be more frequent wrecks and less predictable travel times. They usually are made from incandescent bulbs but are making a transition to the more reliable LED bulbs. They are owned and operated by the government.

Data Centers are also an important example of material technology. This is the building to a company called Cologix which helps the public store, distribute, and access large amounts of data. I have never really thought about what is going on in these buildings until now. They are rooms that consist of massive hard drives and cooling systems that allow for large amounts of data to be stored at any given time. Most other companies will reserve storage in data centers such as this one, not necessarily for public use.
