Bethlehem Steel: This site stood out to me because it is perhaps the most iconic facility in my hometown. I picked it because I thought it was a good representation of “dead tech,” since the plant is now non-operational. It used to be one of the biggest steel manufacturers in the country, but now serves as a tourist venue. There is an outlet mall, banquet hall, casino, hotel, and a concert stage. A company named Wind Creek Hospitality bought SteelStacks for $1.3 billion in 2018, and the residents of Bethlehem, as well as tourists are being serviced. Detailed information on the Bethlehem Steel can be found on the Internet in articles and on Wikipedia.

Stoplight Sensor on Route 378: I noticed this site when this stoplight was renovated a few years ago. I noticed how after the renovation, the light would turn green very shortly after I pulled up to the intersection to cross the highway. I realized that it was an electronic motion sensor that was added that facilitates the color of the traffic light when it senses a vehicle, rather than a simple timing mechanism. The township where I live, Lower Saucon Township, owns the traffic light and its motion detector, and any driver travelling through this intersection in the township is being serviced by this technology. Drivers and pedestrians both benefit since this motion sensor makes waiting at a stoplight more efficient while still ensuring the safety of those using the road.

Fiber Optic Box on a Telephone Pole in my Neighborhood: I noticed this fiber optic box when it was installed a few years back. There is usually a green light on the outside of the box indicating that our Internet is functional, but when the Internet connection at my house is interrupted, the color turns to red. Verizon owns the fiber optic box, since that is where we get our Internet from, and my family is being serviced.

 Cell Phone Tower on Oakhurst: This cell phone tower stood out to me because it is the closest one to my house, and I have driven past it many times over the years. This tower projects a cellular signal that enables phones within its radius to make phone calls, send texts, and use data. A cell phone tower company owns this tower, and a wireless phone company—which happens to be Verizon—and its users are being serviced. I was able to find that this is a Verizon tower on CellMapper.net, but could not find the tower company that owns it.

Transformer Hub on Hickory Hill: I noticed this transformer hub many years ago, as it is located on a road just a couple miles from my house. Transformers convert high voltage power into lower voltage power that can be utilized in houses. The electric company owns this transformer hub, and the homeowners who pay for electricity in the area are being serviced. The electric company benefits because they obtain profits from the homeowners paying their electric bills, and homeowners get working house current in exchange, so both parties benefit.
