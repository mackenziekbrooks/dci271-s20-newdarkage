#Atlanta, GA

###Mt. Paran Monopine Cell Tower:

I selected this location because it was the most out of place looking cell tower trying to be a tree ever. It is a Sprint tower that the neighborhood association allowed as long as it was “disguised”. The tower provides cell coverage and laughs to all those in the vicinity. I couldn’t really find much info on who owns this site; though, it’s most likely sprint.

###DC Blox Data Center:

I selected this location because DC Blox is a relatively new company that owns data centers that connect online businesses and there is one in Atlanta. The data center is a carrier neutral location with meshed 8.8Tbs private optical network connectivity to ATL1 IX at 56 Marietta (per their website). They plan to create locations underserved areas in the Southeast USA using a Tier III design.

###Hemphill Tower:

I selected this location because it is part of a water treatment plant right next to my younger brother’s old school and I would always see the giant tower as I drove by. I tried digging to learn about the tower, but I couldn’t much. I did find that it is owned by the City of Atlanta with attention to the Atlanta Police Dept. which means they might be using this tower for communications between the dispatcher and the officers.

###Bank of America Plaza:

I chose this location because it is the tallest building in Georgia and also because there is a radio tower on top of it. The radio tower broadcasts the W4DOC 146.820 MHz signal which is licensed to the Atlanta Radio Club, an independent broadcasting group. The Bank of America Plaza building is owned by a fund managed by Shorenstein Properties. The radio club broadcasts their “Nets” program from this antenna every Sunday night at 8:00 PM. I also think it is really cool that the tallest building in Atlanta's antenna is being used by an independent broadcasting club rather than a big radio station.
