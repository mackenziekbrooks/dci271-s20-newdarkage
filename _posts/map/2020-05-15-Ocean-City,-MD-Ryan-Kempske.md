This is the substation in south Ocean City Maryland. I noticed it because it is right next to a restaurant that we went to frequently when I was little. I selected this site because it is a major contributor to the power in Ocean City and it also is something that I have recognized as an eye sore for a long time. The Delmarva Power company owns this substation and it transmits and distributes power to the residents in south Ocean City.

This is an AT&T cell tower located right across the street from the substation in Ocean City, Md. It has 2 ball antennas attached to it which provide 5G internet speeds to nearby users. I chose this piece of technology because wireless internet is something that we use constantly throughout the day but don’t usually think about where it comes from. Also, this is one of the few antennas in Maryland however AT&T plans to put up thousands of them throughout the state.

This is a picture of my neighbor’s house which has 10 solar panels on its roof. I chose this as a piece of material technology because not only are these people saving money on their electrical bill, they are also taking a small step in helping our environment. In this case everyone seems to benefit at least a very small amount, but this could be increased if more and more people decide to install solar panels on their house.
