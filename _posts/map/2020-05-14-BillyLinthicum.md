**Annapolis Information Technology Office**
I chose the Annapolis IT office as one location because of the importance it plays in the city’s everyday occurrences. This office is a subdivision of the City Manager’s Office, and it provides services to all city departments. These services include maintaining network hardware, security, Internet and email services, support to the Finance department, and many more. This office is essential to how the city runs, as without these services, we would be at a loss with the use of our technology.

**Annapolis Solar Park**
Annapolis Solar Park is the largest solar energy park in the United States, and is built on a closed landfill in Annapolis, MD. This solar park was built using help from Building Energy S.p.A, BQ Energy, the City of Annapolis, and Anne Arundel County. The entire city of Annapolis is benefitting from this solar park, as it will provide clean and renewable energy for years, as well as save the City of Annapolis approximately $150,000 each year.

**Cell Tower**
This cell tower in Severna Park, MD is owned by AT&T. It provides cell service for all citizens in the surrounding area who use AT&T wireless services, which my family uses. As AT&T users, we have found that cell service is typically very reliable in Severna Park. Although it may be an eye sore on the side of one of Severna Park’s main highways, it provides a valuable services to many citizens.

**AiNET Data Center**
The AiNET Data Center in Glen Burnie, MD is described as a “carrier hotel”. This data center provides services to house carriers in a single cabinet, caged space, or private suite in which to store data. AiNET built and owns the data center, however, it provides services to other companies to benefit from. Although this location is a little bit outside of my town, I have driven up this highway many times and never noticed that this data center existed, but it seems fairly important to the security of the surrounding area’s data.
