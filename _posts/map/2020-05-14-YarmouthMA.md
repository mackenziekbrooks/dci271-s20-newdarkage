**Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory**

Cape Cod potato chips are my favorite type of chip and whenever I drive to the grocery store in Cape Cod, I pass the Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory. The Cape Cod Potato Chip Factory uses up a lot of energy. An article in the Cape Cod Times was posted stating that the factory reduced its energy usage. In particular, the company put money into improving both the HVAC system and the building’s energy management. These improvements have significantly lowered energy usage at the factory.![476MLMA6AFF6XFDJV2QPIFLR4Y.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/476MLMA6AFF6XFDJV2QPIFLR4Y.jpg)

**Radio Tower**

There is a radio tower that I can see from the beach that I’ve always wondered about. I chose this tower as one of my points because a radio tower is a trace of technology that relates to the previous assignment I wrote about the radio. This tower holds two stations: WXTK (FM) and WBAS (AM). The WXTK station is the advanced station of WOCB (the first Cape Cod radio station). Radio towers transmit radio waves to antennas, like the ones on cars! One can’t find much on this specific tower because it belongs to a bigger group (iHeartRadio) and this tower only contains two channels so it’s not a big hub.

**Solar Farm**

This solar farm is one of the main solar sales companies near me in Cape Cod. I’ve never passed this place myself, however I’ve seen multiple houses with solar panels on them and knew that a company must’ve installed them and that’s how I came across the company called My Generation Energy. In addition to installing solar panels, the company also has community solar farms. While my house currently does not use solar power, I think it is very green  to use solar power and I commend the houses that do. ![Screen Shot 2020-05-14 at 4.36.32 PM.png]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/Screen Shot 2020-05-14 at 4.36.32 PM.png) [The Company Website](https://www.mygenerationenergy.com/commercial/)

**Water Tower**

I often see this water tower when I drive around Cape Cod. One thing that I never really thought about what how much technology and energy these towers must use to keep clean water, pressurized and ready for distribution. This water tower is located in Hyannis. It is hard to find a lot of information on this water tower. However, one site provided the information that with this water tower, there are two separate tanks that have the technology that will allow them to work independently or together. ![Water Tower]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/slider-hyannis1.jpg)
