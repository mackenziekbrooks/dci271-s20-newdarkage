Perkiomen pump house- hydroelectric powerplant
![]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/DAM.jpg)

I noticed this and selected it because this is one of the few hydroelectric plants in my area. Perkiomen pumphouse is a hydroelectric plant, that means they build a dam, with turbines and a generator inside it that generate the energy. One way I could do further research was to visit the plant in person, but do to covid I am unable to visit.

Internet
Flexential â€“ Data Center

Flexential is a datacenter located in the greater Philadelphia area. I noticed this because I often drive by it. Datacenters are locations where data is stored and protected in a central location. There are multiple servers that store the data. I could find more information by contacting someone who works there and visiting the center.

Cellular

Global Tower LLC - Cell tower

This is a cell tower located just five minutes from my house. I selected it due to the proximity and frequency I pass it.  The technology in play are electronic communications between the towers and the phones in the surrounding area. In order to find some more information, I could contact the company, Global Tower LLC.

Energy

Wind farm - Locust Ridge wind farm

This one is not nearly as close to my home, but the interesting thing is that this is the closest wind farm to me. The technology in play deals with the turbine and the generation of electricity. The wind turns the mills and the spin generates electricity. Realistically, the only way I could do more research was to contact the corporation that owns the farm.
