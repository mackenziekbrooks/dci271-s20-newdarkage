**Concord Municipal Light Plant:** I selected this location because it is the publicly owned power plant of all the electricity and broadband internet service in my town. This plant provides high speed internet to 95% of the town of Concord, and supplies power to 3 grids in the town of Concord. This is the material form of the internet and power of my town. More info can be found at https://www.concordma.gov/464/Municipal-Light-Plant.

**North East Correctional Solar Panel Field:** This solar field is located on the route that I took to drive to my high school every day, and I selected it because I have seen it so many times, yet never really stopped to think about its implications. The correctional center who is owned by the government owns this field and receives power from the solar panels. I canâ€™t find out how much power the panels generate, and I tried to look on their website, but it says nothing about the solar field.

**Cell Tower:** I chose this cell tower because it is one of many in and around our town. I see cell towers on the side of the highway often. The whole town of concord benefits from this cell tower, because when they are in its range, they receive great cellular service. This cell tower is located right next to the Wastewater Treatment Center off route 62. This cell tower is a Verizon cell tower, which explains why Verizon has the strongest connection in most of our town. 

**Wastewater Treatment Center:** This central center serves approximately 30% of the towns wastewater needs from the sewer system in Concord and West Concord. Once the water is treated, it is released into the river in town. I picked this piece of technology, because the river in town was polluted really badly around 100 years ago, and because of this, no one can swim in it because the water is so dirty. This is such a bummer, and I think it is super important to cleanly dispose of wastewater. More info can be found at https://concordma.gov/387/Project-Overview
