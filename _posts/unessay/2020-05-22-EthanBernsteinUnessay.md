I sought to identify a metaphor for the smartphone. I feel as if most people think of the smartphone as containing many groundbreaking aspects of technology. But, when I thought about it, the smartphone doesn’t incorporate any new and innovative technologies. Rather, the smartphone compiles many existing technologies and refines them to effectively function in one device. That’s when it dawned on me: the fact that the smartphone is able to combine many devices into one IS the technology. Smartphones eliminated the need to have an alarm clock, landline phones, and voice recorders. By “blending” previous technologies into one, the smartphone is making previous technologies obsolete, while simultaneously raising the standard for portability and ease of use.
