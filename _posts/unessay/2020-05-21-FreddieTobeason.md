For my Unessay, I wanted to create a new meaning to the term data stacks: dune stacks. Data stacks is not a common phrase when it comes to a type of technology and therefore, can be mis conceptualized. In my Unessay, I have compared data stacks to sand dunes. Data stacks are groups of data that take points of data, piece them together, and create "stacks". I chose dunes to depict data stacks, because I believe that there isn't just one stack for data and that it all moves around. The sand represents the points of data that all move around to create different hills, similar to stacks. All the sand continues to move on top of mounds, creating new mounds using all different types of data, and allowing all that data to move freely to different stacks. I believe that all the data that is collected is put into several stacks and moves around constantly which is why I have compared data stacks to sand dunes.
