## Undergrounding: Reimagined

After thinking of how “cloud” is used to describe data storage and computation, I was brainstorming new ways to think of my topic, undergrounding. I finally (literally on a hike) stumbled upon tree roots which struck me as very similar to the electric and telecommunication cables and wires that we find below the surface of the ground. During my research, I found that underground and submarine cables are always changing, and the network is consistently expanding, just like tree roots. Also, the cables and wires help us maintain our daily lives just like tree roots help a tree thrive. Aside from the obvious fact that both are contained below the surface, tree roots that help trees emit oxygen and electric cables that help us stay connected aid our lives in many ways. My new quarantine hobby, embroidering, allowed me to express this idea in a clear yet creative way. In this new metaphor, as the tree roots go underground, they become cables and wires which then lead to important locations such as homes, businesses, and schools. Tree roots are always growing and changing, just like the networks that run under cities that allow us to stay interconnected.
