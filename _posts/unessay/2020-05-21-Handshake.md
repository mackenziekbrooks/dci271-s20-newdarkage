I tried to tackle a new metaphor for Bluetooth. To the average person, no one has any idea what Bluetooth stands for or means. It is just a word we now associate with the pairing of two devices over a short distance without any wires or cords. Upon some further research, the term Bluetooth is actually kind of interesting. Harald Bluetooth was the King of Denmark and Norway and was known for his unification of warring tribes in Denmark. My issue with this name is that the average person has no idea who King Bluetooth is, and therefore would not be able to make the connection of similarities of the unification of devices and king Bluetooth’s unification of the warring tribes. My new metaphor is “Handshake,” which is a little bit more intuitive than Bluetooth. Handshake implies the exchange or connection of information because normally after agreements people offer a handshake as a form of solidifying transactions. This is where is inspiration came from for my picture. My drawing depicts an iPhone and a speaker exchanging the album of music the iPhone is listening to, and the new handshake icon in between them implying that they would shake hands after the transaction.
