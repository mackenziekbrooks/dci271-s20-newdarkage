## Artist's Statement
When people talk about algorithms, there is typically an assumption that it acts as a neutral third party. The power of the algorithm in this understanding is that it carries no bias, and therefore can be incredible efficient and fair where humans are less so. However, this is false. Algorithms are Frankenstein's monster: a conglomeration of influences from those who have worked on the program. The biases and perspectives of the programmers, as well as that of the data it takes in to learn, lie within programs themselves. Like Frankenstein's monster, algorithms are both human and not human.

I chose to represent this technological metaphor with a multimedia collage. For the first layer, I cut out and arranged references to technology in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. For the second layer, I created four identical figures out of paper in yellow, red, blue and green, and layered those pieces with body parts from newspapers, magazines and advertisements.
