For my unessay I chose to discuss the metaphor of Instagram by reworking their "about" page and highlighting how Instagram posts can make users feel self conscious and lose self worth. Instagram's about page states that "We bring you closer to the people and things you love." While this is true, and Instagram is widely succesful at connecting users to content that makes them happy and content they enjoy interacting with, there is a downside. On Instagram, users often share only the best and most exciting parts of their lives, leading to sensationalized online personas. As a result, many users often compare themselves to others and try and make their lives the best or most exciting, leading to self consciousness and doubts about self worth. To highlight this dynamic, I reworded Instagram's "about" page to say "We bring you closer to the person you wish you were and the things you wish you had." Following the "About" page I replaced typical Instagram posts with what each post says to a user consuming it from afar. Whether it be from the lake, beach, or a party, the negative side of Instagram is worth being brought to light.
