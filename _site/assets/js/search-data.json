    "content": "Assignment #1: Dead Tech . In order to understand our present, let’s look back at the tech that has shaped our past. In this assignment, you’ll assume the role of a media archaeologist. You will select a single piece of technology and research its creation, impact, and decline. Maybe you’ve heard jokes about Betamax or wondered what happened to all the phone booths –this is your chance to find out! Your findings will be compiled in a 1000 word essay, to be published on our course website. You are encouraged to use images and video to illustrate your essay. This is a research-intensive assignment – you will be required to find, use, and assess 5-7 sources. We will hold a research workshop during the first week of class to identify potential topics and sources. . Assignment #2: Hidden Systems in the Landscape . In chapter 5, Bridle writes about psychogeography and his search for “the places where the great networks of digital technologies become steel and wire.” In this assignment, you will uncover the hidden traces of technology in our local surroundings. Armed with knowledge from our readings and guests in Week 2, you will identify a site of material technology in the landscape and document it for the course website. We’ll place each site on a map so we can see the fuller picture of our local infrastructure. Your documentation should include photos, video, and 500-800 words that address the following questions: What made you notice this site? Why did you select it? What’s happening? Who owns the land and who is being serviced? Who is benefitting and who is not? How can you find out more information about this site? What can’t you find and why? . Assignment #3: Discussion Leader . In groups of 2-3, you will be responsible for leading discussion for 60 minutes for one of the chapters we have yet to cover in New Dark Age. You will research the subject of the chapter and find 2-3 additional readings to complement the topic. The readings should be a mix of scholarly and popular sources. Your discussion questions, readings, and any activities should be approved the day before your discussion. . Assignment #4: New Metaphors Unessay . In New Dark Age, Bridle calls for “new metaphors: a metalanguage for describing the world that complex systems have wrought.” For instance, we’ve learned the reasons why “cloud” is an insufficient metaphor for the global system it represents. We’ve explored many ways that artists and others have visualized the true impact of these metaphors. In this assignment, you will be challenged to come up with your own new metaphor for a modern technological artifact or phenomena of your choosing. The form of this assignment will be the “unessay.” You will decide, with the help of the class, the best presentation for your new metaphor, so long as it is compelling and effective. Unessays will undergo a proposal and peer review process in order to refine your ideas and methods. Unessays will be presented at the Spring Term Festival. . Assignment #5: Reflection . We covered a lot of ground in this course. This is your chance to process what you’ve learned. How has your relationship with technology changed? How do you see the world differently? Where do you see opportunities for agency and justice amidst our complex technological systems? Reflections should be 600-900 words. .",

    "content": "Course Description . Are we living in a “New Dark Age?” Artist and writer James Bridle argues that the abundance of information intended to enlighten the world has, in practice, darkened it. This course will take a big picture look at the interconnected impact of technology on the world around us. Is it enough to learn to code or think computationally? Are we simply at the mercy of unstable and inevitable technological progress? How can we think and act with justice and agency in a world where there is too much to know? How can we uncover the hidden material traces of technology in our surroundings? Through research, hands-on assignments, and local trips, we will seek to understand what has led to our present technological moment and where we can go from here. We will cover topics such as climate change, e-waste, big data, algorithmic bias, and automation. Our goal will be to create new metaphors for understanding the systems around us. .

Attendance . Students are expected to be active, prepared members of this course. Willingness to engage with unfamiliar concepts and technology is essential.

I am committed to ensuring access to course content for all students. Reasonable accommodations are available for students with disabilities. Contact Lauren Kozak, Title IX Coordinator and Director of Disability Resources, to confidentially discuss your individual needs and the accommodation process. More information can be found at https://www.wlu.edu/disability-accommodations/undergraduate-accommodations. . If you have already been approved for accommodations, please meet with me within the first two days of the term so we can develop an implementation plan together. It is important to meet as early in the term as possible; this will ensure that your accommodations are implemented early on. If you have accommodations for test-taking, please remember that arrangements must be made at least a week before the date of the test or exam. . Plagiarism . All writing should be your own or should be cited properly. The writing assignments in this course are different than what is required in other courses, so we will discuss proper citation procedures for writing for the Web, writing in a group, and writing technical documentation.
